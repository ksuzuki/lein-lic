# lein-lic - a leiningen license attacher plugin

You know it's important to release your software under a license of your
choice and your code with a copyright notice and a copying permission
statement. Like your code, however, it's not an "attach and forget"
thing. They need to be maintained properly whenever you update your
software. Yet it's a boring task.

`lein-lic` ('`lic`' for short) is a leiningen plugin to help ease the
task for you.

`lic` can

* place a license file at your project's root directory,
* attach a copyright notice with a copying permission statement to your
  source files, and
* update existing copyright notice.

By default `lic` uses the Eclipse Public License 1.0 and attaches an
auto-generated copyright notice. But you can customize them.

See 'MANUAL.md' for more details.
